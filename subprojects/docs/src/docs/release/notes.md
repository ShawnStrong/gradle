The Gradle team is excited to announce Gradle @version@.

This release supports [a relocatable dependency cache](#cache), makes [compilation order between Java, Groovy and Scala classes configurable](#compilation-order) and kicks off a [new set of downloadable samples](#samples).

There are also several [bug fixes](#fixed-issues), conveniences for [Gradle plugin authors](#plugin-dev) and more.

## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 6.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_6.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).
<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

<a name="cache"></a>
## Gradle's Dependency Cache can be relocated

It has become a common practice to run builds in a CI/CD pipeline with ephemeral agents, meaning single use environments.
This practice of running builds in a _single use environment_ is most often used to improve reliability and reduce potential interactions between builds.
However, it results in longer build times as nothing can be reused from build to build.

A significant overhead caused by this practice with Gradle are the dependency downloads.
Every build has a longer duration caused by fetching all dependencies.
And this can only be resolved by taking an explicit action.
 
[The dependency cache](userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sec:dependency_cache) of builds running with Gradle 6.1 can be relocated, to another directory or host.
When moved to a new location or seeded into a host image, builds will be able to leverage the dependency cache and will not need to access the network to download artifacts or metadata if they are already cached. 

Note that the cache should be primed and consumed by same Gradle version for maximum effect.
See [the documentation](userguide/dependency_resolution.html#sub:cache_copy) for more details. 

<a name="compilation-order"></a>
## Defining compilation order between Groovy, Scala and Java

Previously, the relationship between Java, Groovy and Scala compilation was hardcoded with explicit task dependencies in the same project.
Gradle assumed Groovy and Scala compilation would always depend on Java compilation. That is, `compileGroovy` and `compileScala` would directly depend on the output from `compileJava`.

These task dependencies have been remodelled using [directory properties](userguide/lazy_configuration.html#).  The relationship between compilation tasks is expressed in the task's classpath. Removing a directory property from the classpath also removes the corresponding task dependency.  This can be used to change the relationship between Java, Groovy and Scala compilation tasks.

For example, when combining Groovy and Kotlin in the same project, it was previously difficult to make Kotlin classes depend on Groovy classes.

```
tasks.named('compileGroovy') {
    // Groovy only needs the declared dependencies
    // and not the output of compileJava
    classpath = sourceSets.main.compileClasspath
}
tasks.named('compileKotlin') {
    // Kotlin also depends on the result of Groovy compilation 
    // which automatically makes it depend of compileGroovy
    classpath += files(sourceSets.main.groovy.classesDirectory)
}
```

<a name="samples"></a>
## Downloadable Gradle Samples

In addition to [tutorials and guides](https://guides.gradle.org) and an [extensive user manual](userguide/userguide.html), Gradle now provides an [index of samples](samples/index.html) to demonstrate different kinds of projects that can be built with Gradle, like [Kotlin](samples/index.html#kotlin) or [Spring boot](samples/sample_spring_boot_web_application.html). The samples also show common problems that can be solved using the Groovy or Kotlin DSL, like [adding integration tests to a Java project](samples/sample_jvm_components_with_additional_test_types.html). Each sample comes bundled with a [Gradle wrapper](userguide/gradle_wrapper.html#header), so you don't even need to have Gradle installed before trying them out.

These samples are tested with the same version of Gradle as the documentation. More samples will be added over time. If you have any suggestions for a problem or use case you think would make a good sample, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/new?labels=a%3Asample%2C+from%3Acontributor&template=contributor_sample_request.md).

## Groovy compilation support for method parameter names with JDK8+ 

Gradle 6.1 supports compiling Groovy code and including [method parameter names](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/member/methodparameterreflection.html).

This was contributed by [Andrew Malyhin](https://github.com/katoquro).

## Improvements for plugin authors

### Finalize property value only when the value is queried

In previous Gradle releases, certain Gradle types, such as [`Property`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html) or [`ConfigurableFileCollection`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/file/ConfigurableFileCollection.html),
provided a `finalizeValue()` method that eagerly calculated the final value for a property and prevented further changes.

When a task starts running, Gradle automatically finalizes task properties of these types, so that the same value is seen by the task's actions and Gradle's build caching/up-to-date checks. This also avoids calculating the property value multiple times, which can sometimes be expensive. Plugins can also use `finalizeValue()` to finalize other properties, such as a property of a project extension, just prior to querying the value.

In this release, these types gain a new [`finalizeValueOnRead()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/HasConfigurableValue.html#finalizeValueOnRead--) method. This method is similar to `finalizeValue()`, except that the final value is calculated when the value is queried rather than immediately. Plugins can use this method when a property value may be expensive to calculate or when the value may not have been configured to ensure that all consumers of the property see the same, final, value from that point onwards.

Please see the [user manual](userguide/lazy_configuration.html#unmodifiable_property) for more details.

### New managed property types

Gradle 5.5 introduced the concept of a [_managed property_ for tasks and other types](userguide/custom_gradle_types.html#managed_properties), where Gradle provides an implementation of the getter 
and setter for an abstract property defined on a task, project extension, or other custom type.
This simplifies plugin implementations by removing a bunch of boilerplate.

In this release, it is possible for a task or other custom type to have an abstract read-only property of type [`DomainObjectSet<T>`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/DomainObjectSet.html).

Please see the [user manual](userguide/custom_gradle_types.html#managed_properties) for more details.

### New factory methods

The [`ObjectFactory`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html) type, which plugins and other custom types use to create instances of various useful types, has several new factory methods to create certain Gradle types that could only be created using internal APIs in previous releases: 

- The [`polymorphicDomainObjectContainer()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#polymorphicDomainObjectContainer-java.lang.Class-) method to create [`ExtensiblePolymorphicDomainObjectContainer<T>`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/ExtensiblePolymorphicDomainObjectContainer.html) instances.
- The [`namedDomainObjectSet()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#namedDomainObjectSet-java.lang.Class-) method to create [`NamedDomainObjectSet<T>`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/NamedDomainObjectSet.html) instances.
- The [`namedDomainObjectList()`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/model/ObjectFactory.html#namedDomainObjectList-java.lang.Class-) method to create [`NamedDomainObjectList<T>`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/NamedDomainObjectList.html) instances.

Please see the [user manual](userguide/custom_gradle_types.html#collection_types) for more details.

## Improvements for Gradle tooling providers

### Tooling API: `TestLauncher` can run specific `Test` task tests

The `TestLauncher` interface in the Tooling API could already launch tests by specifying the name of the test classes or methods; however, if there are multiple `Test` tasks, then all `Test` tasks would be executed. 

For IDEs, developers usually want to execute only one task at a time. Gradle 6.1 introduces a new API to execute tests with specific `Test` task using the `withTaskAndTestClasses()` and `withTaskAndTestMethods()` methods.
